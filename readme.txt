alphamask:
  - the thresholds.txt file contains 3 doubles, each on a different line
    line 1 is hue, line 2 is saturation, and line 3 is value, change these values
    to change the screening behavior of the program (blue screen green screen etc...)
    The recommended thresholds are the following:
50.0
0.7
0.2
    The program will break if you put anything other than numbers in this file,
    please don't do that.
